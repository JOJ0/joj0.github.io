## What can we do with MIDI?

* Play notes
* Change parameters 
* Change programs/presets
* ...

## What is MIDI?

* a serial communication protocol
* bitrate of 31250 bps (bits per second), also called "baud rate"
* each message consists of 2 or 3 bytes

### MIDI messages


```
| Value (dec) | Value (Hex) | Command          | Data bytes                |
| ------------| ----------- | ---------------  | ------------------------- |
| 128-143     | 80-8F       | Note off         | 2 (note, velocity)        |
| 144-159     | 90-9F       | Note on          | 2 (note, velocity)        |
| 160-175     | A0-AF       | Key Pressure     | 2 (note, key pressure)    |
| 176-191     | B0-BF       | Control Change   | 2 (controller no., value) |
| 192-207     | C0-CF       | Program Change   | 1 (program no.)           |
| 208-223     | D0-DF       | Channel Pressure | 1 (pressure)              |
| 224-239     | E0-EF       | Pitch Bend       |                           |
| ------------| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------|
```

16 MIDI channels

Note byte 1 (channel):
* Channel 1: 144
* Channel 2: 145
* Channel 16: 159

Note byte 2 (note number):
```
C0  = 0
C1  = 24
C#1 = 25
C4  = 60
A4  = 60
C5  = 72
```

CC message:
* Channel 1: 176
* Channel 2: 177
* Channel 16: 191


#### Examples

Send a NoteOn message for the note of D#3 on channel 1 with a velocity of 90:

```
144 | 36 | 90
```

Send a Control Change message for Controller number 81 on channel 2 with a value of 65
```
177 | 81 | 65
```

<br />
Can we choose any CC number for our controller?

### Nano specifics

The Nano is very similar to the well-known Arduino Uno, it only is smaller and has more connection possibilities.

#### Chinese Nano clones (CH340)

The Arduino Nano clones we use, have a CH340 chip that does the USB to serial conversion. To program it we need a USB-driver specific to our computers operating system.

[For Mac OS X High Sierra and above we need this driver](https://blog.sengotta.net/signed-mac-os-driver-for-winchiphead-ch340-serial-bridge/)

[For Windows 10 we need this one](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)


##### Programming settings

Golden USB socket version:
* Board: _Arduino Nano_
* Processor: _ATmega328b_

Silver USB socket version:
* Board: _Arduino Nano_
* Processor: _ATmega328b (old bootloader)_

Both types:
* Select the correct serial port
   * Mac OS X: something called /dev/cu.something (eg. /dev/cu.wchusbserial1410)
   * Windows: COMx (eg COM4, COM10, ...)
       * use the _Devicemanager_ to find out which COM port appears when you connect the Arduino to the USB port

If our programming settings or the CH340 driver are wrong this is one of the possible errors:

```avrdude: stk500_getsync(): not in sync: resp=0x00```


### Pro Micro specifics

[nice Pro Micro connections video-tutorial, also about multiplexing input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0v2clCVw9k)

#### Chinese Pro Micro clones

Specifically this chip: ATmega32U4 5V 16MHz

##### Programming settings
* Board: _Arduino Leonardo_
* Select the correct serial port
   * Mac OS X: something called /dev/cu.something
   * Windows: COMx (eg COM4, COM10, ...)
       * use the _Devicemanager_ to find out which COM port appears when you connect the Arduino to the USB port


## Wiring power connections and a button

To power the plus- and minus-rails of our breadboard we connect the <em>5V</em> and <em>GND</em> pins to it. On the <em>Pro Micro</em> the <em>5V</em> pin is called <em>VCC</em>.

<div class="clearfix">
  {% include thumb.html filename='/images/2019-9-13-midilab/vcc_ground_switch.jpg' alt_text='' caption='' width="49%" float="left" %}

  <div style="width: 49%; float: right;">

The position of the switch and its wiring on the breadboard is <strong>wrong in this pic</strong> and can damage the Arduino! Refer to the pics in chapter <a href="#wiring_midi">Wiring the MIDI socket</a> for the correct position and wiring of the switch.

  </div>
</div>

### So why is position and wiring of the switch wrong?

The buttons we use are so called DPDT switches (Dual Pole Double Throw). This basically means that we can use this switch to _switch on/off_ or _toggle_ two things with one buttonpress. Or put differently: Two switches in one.


<div class="clearfix">
  {% include thumb.html filename='/images/2019-9-13-midilab/dpdt_toggle_switch_diagram.png' alt_text='' caption='This is how a regular DPDT switch is working. Pins 1, 3, 5 represent one toggle switch and pins 2, 4, 6 the other one. If we would plug in one of <em>those</em> into the breadboard as on the photograph above we would be perfectly fine: Even though we connected some pins together via the vertical rows of the breadboard (pin-pairs 1+2, 3+4 and 5+6 would connect), everything would be working as it should: Our goal is to connect <strong>one</strong> Arduino pin (D2) to either 5V or GND (high or low). We actually don&#39;t care that we can&#39;t use the second switch in our DPDT anymore.' width="49%" float="left" %}

  {% include thumb.html filename='/images/2019-9-13-midilab/dpdt_push_switch_diagram.png' alt_text='' caption='The switches <em>we</em> use are also DPDT switches that certainly can also be used to toggle two things at a time, only that their two (vertical) pin rows don&#39;t operate <em>in parallel</em> - their pinout is completely different.<br/>
  Let&#39;s use the same pin numbering as on the regular DPDT diagram/schematic on the left for our oddly wired switches: In off-state 1+5 and 2+6 connect. In on-state it&#39;s 1+3 and 4+6. So what actually happens when we plug in the power (connect Arduino to USB port) is: We connect + and - pole together and thus short-circuit the Arduino which he can withstand for a short time only.' width="49%" float="right" %}
