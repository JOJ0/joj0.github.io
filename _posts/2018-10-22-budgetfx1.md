Sometimes DIY is frustrating: Projects are stuck, things break, components are missing or unavailable, and again you are uncertain if the thing you are trying to build will ever do what you want...

So squeezing in a project with a more or less predictable end might help gain back some motivation...and these days...could help making another lockdown bearable.

This post is about something rather easy, I suppose even doable for people just starting out with electronics: Building a "guitar stomp FX box" from a made-up kit - [The Phazer](https://www.musikding.de/The-Phaser-Phaser-kit). My favorite components shop [musikding.de](https://musikding.de) sent me this kit for free a long time ago already. I had asked them for some promo material and promised I'll do a post about building it. Years later...

Funnily enough I didn't take any picture of the actual soldering of the circuit board but let me tell you that getting done the PCB is not the tricky part. If you've never soldered before, watch some youtube. Here's some basics I find useful: Start with small components, then advance to bigger ones. Don't put too much heat on semiconductor-based components but don't make the typical beginners-mistake of putting too less heat: It would only force you to touch the components even longer because that damn solder is not melting!

Finally, let's get to what this post is really about: Fitting everything into a tiny case...
