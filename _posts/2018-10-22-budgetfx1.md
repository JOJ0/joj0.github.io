Sometimes DIY is frustrating: Projects are on-hold because things broke, components are missing or difficult to find, and again you are uncertain if the thing you are trying to build will ever do what you want...

So squeezing in a project with a more or less predictable end might help gain back some motivation...and these days...could help making another lockdown bearable.

This post is the first in a series of posts for beginners and aforementioned people trying to finally finish something ;-): Building "guitar FX stomp boxes" from made-up kits - We start with [The Phazer](https://www.musikding.de/The-Phaser-Phaser-kit). My favorite components shop [musikding.de](https://musikding.de) kindly sent me this kit for free a long time ago already. I had asked them for some promo material and promised I'll do a post about building it. Years later...

Funnily enough I didn't take any picture of the actual soldering of the circuit board but let me tell you that getting done the PCB is not the tricky part. If you've never soldered before, watch some youtube. Future posts in this series might contain some PCB soldering pics but here's some basics I usually try to follow: Start with small components, then advance to bigger ones. Don't put too much heat on semiconductor-based components but don't make the typical beginners-mistake of putting too less heat on your soldering iron: It would only force you to touch the components rather long because that damn solder is not melting!

Finally, let's get to what this post is really about: Fitting everything into a tiny case...

## Think ahead

Once you've drilled holes in your case its too late to reconsider! For this project I used an aluminium case from [Hammond Manufactoring](http://www.hammondmfg.com/dwg_SBVer.htm). These cases seem to be a kind of a standard for DIY guitar stomp boxes. You might want to [get a pre-colored case along with your order](https://www.musikding.de/Aluminium-enclosure-Coloured) or [choose the cheaper option and color it yourself](https://www.musikding.de/Aluminium-enclosure-Natural). For a lot of kits at the shop, the "Box Type B" is the right choice. The manufacturer's partnumber is "1590B". Make up your mind where you want the FX in/out jacks, knobs and switches, and the power connector.

  <ul class="photo-gallery-list">
    {% for photo in site.budgetfx1 offset: 0 limit: 5 %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ photo.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" name="{{ photo.title }}">
        <img src="{{ photo.image-path|remove: '.jpeg'| append: '-th'|append: '.jpeg' }}" alt="{{ photo.caption }}" style="width: 31%" />
      </a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>


## Make sure it fits

To really make sure all your components fit into the case, consider building _a cardboard prototype_. At this point it's like you'll reconsider the placing of certain components. You'll find exact measurements on the case manufacturers website. Draw the template yourself or just google for "Hammond 1590B drilling template".

  <ul class="photo-gallery-list">
    {% for photo in site.budgetfx1 offset: 5 limit: 17 %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ photo.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" name="{{ photo.title }}">
        <img src="{{ photo.image-path|remove: '.jpeg'| append: '-th'|append: '.jpeg' }}" alt="{{ photo.caption }}" style="width: 31%" />
      </a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>

## The point of no return

You've planned thoroughly - drill the holes! In my case I decided last minute to use a regular switch instead of the foot switch that came with the kit. It needs to be a 3-way switch!

  <ul class="photo-gallery-list">
    {% for photo in site.budgetfx1 offset: 22 limit: 10 %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ photo.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" name="{{ photo.title }}">
        <img src="{{ photo.image-path|remove: '.jpeg'| append: '-th'|append: '.jpeg' }}" alt="{{ photo.caption }}" style="width: 31%" />
      </a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
