Sometimes DIY is frustrating: Projects are stuck, things break, components are missing or unavailable, and again you are uncertain if this thing (you've often never done before) will work out after all.

So squeezing in a project that's "known to be working" helps getting the motivation back.

So, this post is about something rather easy, probably also doable for people that never had to do anything with electronics. Building a guitar-stomp-FX-box from a made-up kit. musikding.de was so kind to send me this kit for free.

<div class="photo-gallery-frame clearfix">
  <ul class="photo-gallery-list">
    {% for photo in site.mpc-service %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ photo.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" name="{{ photo.title }}">
        <img src="{{ photo.image-path|remove: ".jpg"| append: '-th'|append: ".jpg" }}" alt="{{ photo.caption }}" />
      </a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
