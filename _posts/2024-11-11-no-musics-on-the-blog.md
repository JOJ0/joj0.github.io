Why is there no music on this blog? After all it is about music tinkering and stuff! Well, you are right, there should be music and now there is.

During a three months road trip through southern Italy, I discovered my own pseudonym DJ project. It features - not only but many - _vocal tracks_, some Italian, but also German and English ones (ABAY, Edoardo Bennato, Bilderbuch, Rino Gaetano); some modern Italian and British electronic gems (Dina Summer, Almamegretta, The Comet is Coming) as well as some classic 70's vibes in both Italian and German language (Pino D'Angio, Hildegard Knef).

Thanks to the always friendly and chill staff at northern sicilian campsite _Lo Scoglio_ for introducing me to "Almamegretta", a Dub &amp; World music artist from Naples. Best served on a 35 degrees afternoon under the shade of their restaurant's terrace. <3. Further credits go to those Italians that decided this (DJ-) person's name should rather be "Giovanni" than "Jojo" for better flow in their mother tongue. Some artists were in the driving playlist ever since of course (The Comet is Coming. Thanks P.W-L). And certainly the biggest thanks goes to my co-pilot, tune selector, best travel companion and wife Christl.
