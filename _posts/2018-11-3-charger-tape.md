Alright, let's do something boring: Building a battery charger. So why would you do that? I dont't have any idea, just go buy one! ;-) But apparently I had a reason to build one myself:

Some time ago I built a couple of rechargeable button-cell-battery-packs which are featured in [this post]({% post_url 2017-9-24-das-adhs %}#building-7-segment)<br>After trying to recharge one of them with an old NiCd fast-charger I learned the hard way how my batteries actually look from the inside:

  </div>
</div>

Don't try this at home kids! 

So far so good, I didn't burn my flat yet, so I decided to either buy or build a charger that is designed to charge Nickel-Metal Hybride (NiMH) batteries with very little capacity.


## What you always wanted to know about rechargeable batteries

First off, my tiny button cell accumulators have the following specs:

  * 1,2 V (exactely the same as normal AA, AAA, etc. rechargable batteries;
    this value is nominal, in reality most of them have a little more, something like 1,3 to 1,45 when fully charged) 
  * 80 mAh ([milliampere hours](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/milliampere-hour-mAh)) capacity

In short: They are ordinary rechargeable batteries and it actually should be save to load them with an ordinary charger.

So why did my test-candidate explode then?

It was simply overcharged. NiMH cells are designed to be only fast-charged until they reach their full capacity. After that, keeping them connected to high current results in a lot of heat and...you saw the pics.

So either the charger has thermal sensors to shut off before overheating, or it just uses a low current the cell can withstand for a longer (infinite) time duration.

Sensoring seemed tedious so I decided to build a low current charger.

A safe current for NiMH cells is 1/10 of their capacity (1/10 C) or even less. In my batteries case this would be 1/10 * 80 = 8mA. There you have it: No affordable charger on the market seems to handle such a low current. Typically chargers go as low as 150 mA, which is fine for typical batteries which have a capacity of 1500 mAh to 2500 mAh (or even more), but not for my tiny 80 mAh cells.


## Finding and customizing a circuit design
<a name="finding"></a>

Some googling and studying charger designs brought up [this forum thread](https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/constant-nimh-trickle-charger.14624/). The schematic suggested by member SgtWookie seemed to be a perfect fit:

It features two regulator ICs (TLV1117C): One limiting the current (U1) and the other one the voltage (U2). The battery(pack) is represented by capacitor C2 (he uses the similar-to-battery-behaviour of the capacitor for the software simulation). I substituted the two regulators with the more common and easy to get LM317 type.


* **Charging voltage** should be set slightly higher than the voltage of the fully charged battery pack. My two-cell packs have about 2 * 1,35 = 2,7 V so around **2,8-2,9 V** should be fine.
  * Fortunately the design already handles charging voltage for two-cell packs. It can be fine tuned using the **trim-pot R5**.
  * measure between point A and ground

* **Charging current** as discussed above, not more than **8 mA**.
  * It is set by **resistors R1,R2** (On first sight it is slightly confusing that he uses 2 identical resistors in parallel. I suppose he did this to split the current  (and thus the power consumption) in half and spare the use of an R with higher power specs (more Watts - more expensive - not as common in ones components stash), I will use just one R as my current is very little compared to the 260 mA in the original design. Let’s just call my resistor R1 and forget about R2.).
  *  open circuit between points A and B and connect multimeter in between for measuring

If you have a look on pages 12 and 13 in the [LM317 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm317.pdf) you will find examples for current and voltage limiting circuits that look almost identical to SgtWookies design. His circuit is basically a combination of two examples. Well done!

This is my final customized version. The 120k resistor limits charging current to 6mA, being even more healthy for my batteries:

### Some theory for the geeks

Skip this if it’s boring ;-) I’ll try to explain why in my case R2 surely is not necessary.


#### R1 power consumption - Original design 

Assuming R2 is missing:

The formula for calculating the power consumption of a device (eg. a resistor) is

P = V * I

The V on R1 is unknown so just calculate it using Ohm’s law:

V = R * I = 10 Ohm * 260 mA = 10 * 0,26 = 2,6 V

Now find out how much power R1 has to withstand:

P = V * I = 2,6 * 0,26 = 0,676 W (Watts)

The most common resistors support max power levels of 0,3 to 0,5 Watts. With splitting the current in half by using a second resistor R2 in parallel with R1, also the power consumption is halfed to 0,338 W for each R.


#### R1 power consumption - Customized design

V = R * I = 120 Ohm * 6 mA = 120 * 0,006 = 0,72 V

P = V * I = 0,72 * 0,006 = 0,00432 W = 4,3 mW

4,3 milliwatts is almost nothing and every resistor form factor I know of would withstand it. No need for splitting the current in half with a second R.


#### How long does it take to load then?

theoretically:

t = C / I = 80mAh / 6mA = 0,080 / 0,006 = 13,33 h

I -> current in A<br>
C -> capacity in Ah<br>
t -> time in h

typically a loss of 30-40% has to be counted in, lets calc with 40%:

C = 0,080 + 40% = 0,080 * 1,4 = 0,112
t = C / A = 0,112 / 0,006 = 18,66 h

So let’s say a night and something. It should be safe to leave the charger connected for a couple of days.

### Materials

[LM317 regulator](https://www.musikding.de/LM317T_1)<br>

Those are for building power and battery connector plugs:<br>
[10 pin strip (for 4-pin battery connector and 5-pin power supply connector ](https://www.musikding.de/10-Pin-strip)<br>

Unfortunately musikding.de doesn't have the female ones in stock.

Take [these 20 pin inline sockets](https://www.musikding.de/20-Pin-inline-socket) for the resistor connector and the additional regular-battery-holder connector. They are also called transistor-sockets. Keep in mind that they have small holes. Above pin strips won't fit together with them!<br> 

These are some combination packs with headers and sockets that fit together. It's Amazon affiliate links. Click them if you like what you read, I get a tiny percentage of what you bought then. Thanks!<br>

For resistor buy anything, anywhere. I like [Metal Film types](https://www.musikding.de/Metal-Film-06W), they are quite cheap but can stand about 0,6 Watts, which is a little more than the most common ones with 0,25 Watts (I think they are called carbon-layer). You won't need a lot of power in your resistors for this project but it's good to have some in the stash.
