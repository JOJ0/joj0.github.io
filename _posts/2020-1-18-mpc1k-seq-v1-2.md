I just released a new version of my "AKAI MPC 1000 sequence file command line utility".

Probably the biggest news is that you now don't need any form of Python installed on your computer, because I provide executable files for MacOS and Windows that contain all the Python stuff the tool needs. Full release notes and download here: [mpc1k-seq version 1.2](https://github.com/JOJ0/mpc1k-seq/releases/tag/v1.2)

Read what this tool is actually about in the [updated original blog post]({% post_url 2018-4-15-mpc1k-seq %}).

And as always: your valuable feedback is appreciated!
