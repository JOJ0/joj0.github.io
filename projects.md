Sometimes I don't even know myself in what projects I am currently involved.
This site should function as an overview of the most relevant things I am
working on / am a part of.

## FOSS Projects

I love *F*ree and *O*pen *S*ource *S*oftware. This is a list
of projects I am directly involved with.

### python3-discogs-client

A Python module for easy accessing the API provided by https://discogs.com. Together
with two other european coders, we took over the abandoned github repo. Discogs
didn't have interest in maintaining the Python module anymore but a lot of
records lovers that also code Python do!

- [our announcement thread on the official Discogs board](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/822690)
- [latest releases / changelog](https://github.com/joalla/discogs_client/releases)

### DiscoDOS

A sophisticated and flexible CLI tool for managing a DJ's record collection.
DiscoDOS makes heavy use of above mentioned Python module.

### synadm

synadm is a CLI tool to ease access to the administration API of
Synapse servers. Synapse is the reference "homeserver" implementation of the
Matrix standard. Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised,
real-time communication over IP. For details on the standard go to
https://matrix.org. For details on the number one multi-platform Matrix
client go to https://element.io.

Most of all: Matrix is a user-friendly chat and instant messaging system.
There was no comfortable administration tool available for a Synapse
homeserver that suited my needs, thus I wrote one. Admins of such servers
seem to welcome it quite frankly.
