title: Too Many Projects!
permalink: /projects/
---

Sometimes I don't even know myself how many projects I currently have in the
backlog. This site is an overview of the most relevant things I am
working on / am a part of.

## FOSS

I love **F**ree and **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware. This is a list
of projects I am directly involved with.

### python3-discogs-client

A Python module for accessing the API provided by
[https://discogs.com](https://discogs.com).
Two other coders and me took over the abandoned github
repo in June 2020. Discogs didn't have interest in maintaining the Python
module anymore but a lot of record lovers that also code Python do!

- [latest releases / changelog](https://github.com/joalla/discogs_client/releases)

### DiscoDOS

A flexible CLI tool for managing a DJ's record collection and supporting them
with selecting appropriate records for their mixes. DiscoDOS makes heavy use
of above mentioned Python module. Head over to its website to read all about
it.

### synadm

synadm is a CLI tool to ease access to the administration API's of Synapse
servers. Synapse is the reference "homeserver" implementation of the Matrix
standard. Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised,
real-time communication over IP. For details on the standard go to
[https://matrix.org](https://matrix.org). For details on the number one
multi-platform Matrix enduser client go to
[https://element.io](https://element.io).

Most of all: Matrix is a user-friendly chat and instant messaging system.
There was no administration tool available for Synapse homeservers that
suited my needs, thus I wrote one. Other Admins of such servers seem to
welcome it quite frankly.

Contributions and feature requests are sent regularily but still I am looking
for one or two persons interested in the topic that help me advance it to a
state that it supports _all_ of the admin API's Synapse currently is offering
and then help further maintaining the code base.

### Maschinenraum

A reoccuring techno club-night I am co-organizing. Well, _was_ co-organizing,
since the covid crisis but also for other reasons there is not much going in
this project.

### Broken Dreams

A club-night bringing back UK-style old-school Hardcore, Rave and Jungle. It
took place once....and then came Covid..... Actually I had a lot of
motivation for this rather new project (2019). We will see if I restart it
once it's possible again.

### J0J0 Todos music

I did produce a couple of electronic music tracks in the past but also not
much going on in this area these days - too many projects! But currently
motivation comes back to work on new tracks and finish old one's. Also I am
a DJ covering a lot of styles from electronic to analog music. Have a look at my
soundcloud and mixcloud pages for a taste.
