An overview of the most relevant things I am working on and the projectes I'm involved with.

## FOSS Projects

I love **F**ree and **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware. I created a separate website around my professional skillset that also hosts a list of Open Source projects I maintain and participate in:

### Maschinenraum

A reoccuring techno club-night I am co-organizing. Well, _was_ co-organizing,
since the covid crisis but also for other reasons there is not much going in
this project.

### Broken Dreams

A club-night bringing back UK-style old-school Hardcore, Rave and Jungle. It
took place once....and then came Covid..... Actually I had a lot of
motivation for this rather new project (2019). We will see if I restart it
once it's possible again.

### J0J0 Todos music

I did produce a couple of electronic music tracks in the past but also not
much going on in this area these days - too many projects! But currently
motivation comes back to work on new tracks and finish old one's. Also I am
a DJ covering a lot of styles from electronic to analog music. Have a look at my
soundcloud and mixcloud pages for a taste.
